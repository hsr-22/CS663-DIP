This 500-image sequence spans about 50 seconds.  Thus the
tracker ran at 10 Hz.

The file 'ellipse_states.txt' contains the exact ellipse 
positions and sizes that the algorithm computed at run time.
The files 'loc_*.m' were computed off-line using one or 
more of the modules.

To get 'loc_color.m' and 'loc_colordot.m' the tracker was run
with Stan's color model.  But, the results are still quite good.

Image 288-299 were corrupted and overwritten with 287 and 300.
